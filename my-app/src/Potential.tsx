            As the emergence of the deepfake technology, concerns have been raised regarding to its application and potential threats. The public can easily generate deepfakes videos that mimics the identity of the target, and this can give rise to malicious act or even crime.

            One of the most famous application of deepfake is deepfake pornography. It start capturing people's attention since an incident in 2017, where English actress Daisy Ridley has her facial feature placed onto a pornographic actress by a Reddit user. The realistic looking video has aroused public attention, and deepfake pornography has gain its popularity since then. A report published in 2019 shows that over 96% of the deepfake content were related to pornography. While some regard these videos as entertaining, this creates problems. As mentioned by a Hollywood star Scarlette Johansson, who is a frequent target by deepfake pornongraphy creators, for those women that is not well-known or famous to the extend that their fame can protect themselves from the public, their reputation can be damaged, where audience might disregard the authenticity of the video.
            Indeed, the victim of the videos suffers under pressure of rumours, which not only breaks their their public image, but also creates psychological problems. Besides, this attack can create fake hidden dirt to be used to embarrass victims or for blackmailing, accounting for possible monetary loss. While the technology is growing much mature, as a citizen living in the digital era, we must be aware of our actions.

            Besides from targeting actresses in pornography, political figures are also the targets for generating deepfake videos, forcing legislative and adminstrative departments to get involved and face up to the problem. The following marks some recent incidents:

            But of course, besides drawbacks, deepfakes foster a healthy development to the society if the application is benign. One of them is the potential use of deepfake technology in the movie industry. The movie industry requires a large amount of CGIs during filming and post-production, such as the motion capture and VFX. Deepfakes have been targeted to be a potential tool for post production due to a relative lower cost then the current methods. While currently the open source of deepfake codes works well in 256x256 dimention, the resolution of the result produced by deepfakes is too low for the big screens. Currently it is only common for fan-made videos only. But with the emergence of deepfake generation technology, it is highly possibe that it can be used in the Hollywood industry. For instance, Disney Research Studio is researching for a higher resolution, which hopefully can participate in its movie production. Besides, deepfake hobbyist remakes de-aged actor in the shows that exhibit a much superior result comparing to CGI manipulated result, indicating the possibility in future production.

            Another application that most of us may know is the photo and video filters. For instance, there is a famous Snapchat filter performing face swapping. Some of these filters also involves the use of deepfake technology. Despite the threats brought by deepfake, the technology can benefit and contibute to the society. The technology itself is just a tool, the benefits or harm brought by its application solely depends on the intention of the creator. The rising tide of the technology is inevitable, as responsible citizens, we should leverage the technology to make contribution and development to the society.
